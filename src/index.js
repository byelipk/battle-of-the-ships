// Battleship
//
// 4 10x10 grid4 - two for each player.
//   -- letters A-J identify the rows and numbers 1-10 identify the columns
//
// One one grid the player arranges their ships and tracks shots from their
// opponent; on the second grid, the player tracks their shots.
//
// Before the game begins, each player arranges their primary grid.
// Each ship occupies n consecutive horizontal or vertical squares on the grid.
// The number of consecutive spaces is determined by the type of ship.
// The ships cannot overlap.
//
// Possible ships/spaces:
//
// Carrier (5)
// Battleship (4)
// Cruiser (3)
// Submarine (3)
// Destroyer (2)

// NOTE
// The meat of the API is in a file called `functions.js`.
// The classes in this file represent the domain models 
// that I'd use to build out the game played if it was played 
// in the terminal. Implementing the game is outside the scope 
// of the exercise as I understand it, but if that's something 
// you want I'd be happy to do so.
